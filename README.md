## Comparison Between iOS SwiftUI and Android Compose
In SwiftUI, you can navigate seamlessly between code and preview: clicking a component in the preview layout takes you directly to the source code, and clicking on a code block highlights the component in the preview. This two-way navigation enhances the development experience.

In Android Compose, however, navigation is one-wayâ€”you can only highlight the code block by clicking on the component in the preview.
